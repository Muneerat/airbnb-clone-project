### 🔍 Importance of Identifying Design Properties in a Mockup

Identifying the design properties (such as colors, fonts, spacing, and element behavior) from a mockup is critical to accurately translating the designer's vision into functional code. It ensures:

- 🎯 **Consistency**: Developers maintain visual and functional consistency across all components.
- 🛠️ **Efficiency**: Reduces guesswork during implementation, saving time and effort.
- 🧩 **Scalability**: Makes it easier to reuse styles and components across multiple pages.
- 🤝 **Collaboration**: Bridges the communication gap between designers and developers by using a shared visual language.
- 📐 **Precision**: Delivers a pixel-perfect user interface that matches the intended user experience.

By identifying these design properties early, teams ensure a smooth transition from design to development, leading to better performance and user satisfaction.

## 🧱 UI Component Patterns

To maintain a clean, modular, and scalable frontend architecture, the project will be built using reusable UI components. Below are the planned components and their key elements:

---

### 🔝 Navbar

A responsive top navigation bar that includes:

- **Logo**: Linked to the home page
- **Search bar**: For quick property lookup
- **User navigation**: Includes login/logout, profile, and booking history
- **Responsive menu**: Collapses into a mobile-friendly hamburger menu

---

### 🏘️ Property Card

A reusable card component to display property listings:

- **Property image**: Featured image of the listing
- **Basic details**: Price, location, and rating
- **Favorite button**: For adding/removing saved properties
- **Responsive layout**: Optimized for various screen sizes

---

### 👣 Footer

A global footer section appearing across all pages:
